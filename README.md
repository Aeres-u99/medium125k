# medium125k

This is a data set of more than 125,000 titles and subtitles of post published at [medium.com](https://medium.com). The data is formatted as CSV and the columns are: 
<br>
<br>

![](/explain.svg)

<br>
<br>

The data set should only contain english posts, but sometimes a foreign title slipped through the Medium language detector (e.g. chinese). However, not many of these are present in the set and manual cleanup shouldn't take too long (if you did this, open a PR please).
